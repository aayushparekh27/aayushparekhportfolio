## 🚀 Quick Start (Run Locally)

> If this is a static site (index.html exists):

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
cd <your-repo>
```

2. Open `index.html` directly in the browser (or use a simple live server):

```bash
# If using VSCode:
Open with Live Server (extension)
```

> If the project uses NPM scripts (React/Vite/Next etc.):

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the dev server
npm run dev         # or
npm start
```
